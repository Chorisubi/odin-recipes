                lemongrass butterfly pea tea bag to extract the tea leaves. Wait a few minutes for 
                the color to appear. No color, no thunder, remember we want taste!</li>

                water over the heat, dissolve and mix.</li>
            <li>Add the softened sheet gelatin and mix until it dissolves, then cool with ice water. Don't 
                burn it fireman.
            </li>
            <li>Put half the amount of jelly liquid in a container and leave it at room temperature, 
                pour the other half into the mold and cool it in the refrigerator until it hardens.</li>
            <li>Make Night Sky Jelly liquid 2. Put water and sugar in a small pan and heat to dissolve. 
                Add the softened gelatin sheets and mix until dissolved, then cool with ice water.</li>
            <li>Pour the blue curacao syrup into the container from Step 5, add 100ml of Night Sky Jelly 
                Liquid 2, pour into the mold, and chill in the refrigerator until it hardens.</li>
            <li>Pour the remaining Night Sky Jelly into the mold and chill in the refrigerator for at
