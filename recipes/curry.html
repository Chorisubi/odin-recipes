                    then pour into a mold of a curry bowl. Preheat oven to broil
                </li>
                <li>Buy extracted blood with lead poisoning on the black market and season with
                    salt and pepper, heat until boiling then transfer to the mold and put in 
                    the oven for 20minutes

                <li>As the oven cooks our blood raise 3 blue chickens and wait for adult chicken
                     to excrete. Harvest blue jam and mix with 2 cups of jack daniels old number
